        David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice 
        and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which

        Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on 
        April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over 
        eight seasons.Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos,
        Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows 
        several story arcs throughout the course of the show. 
        The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of 
        Westeros through a web of political conflicts among 
        the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for 
        independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last 
        descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to 
        Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.
         The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending 
         the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border.
